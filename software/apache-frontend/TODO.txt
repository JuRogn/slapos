Apache:
=======
- set a redirection of / in option
- Implement support of multiple ip (if possible) for multiple ssl (other solution is to ask master instance but quid to much apache process?)

Squid:
======
- Only cache in ram. Problems with to much squid on the computer or too many slave?

SlapOS:
=======
- Implement intelligent apache graceful -> Should check slave configuration and return error to slave if there is a problem (important but difficult)
- useless srv/squid_cache directory so far
