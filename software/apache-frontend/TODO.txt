Apache:
=======
- Return parameters "site-url" for backward compatibility (important)
- Use gzip by default (important)
- set a redirection of / in option
- Implement support of multiple ip (if possible) for multiple ssl (other solution is to ask master instance but quid to much apache process?)
- SSL engine on port 80? (important)
- Log use info instead of warning to log access ?
- Check ipv6 for master instance and provide it to slave instances

Squid:
======
- Only cache in ram. Problems with to much squid on the computer or too many slave?

SlapOS:
=======
- Move slave configuration directory to etc (generated by slapgrid)
- Order and split templates into sub-directories. eg: One subdirectory per software type and one common directory.
- Rename templates to be more explicit
- Implement intelligent apache graceful -> Should check slave configuration and return error to slave if there is a problem (important but difficult)
- useless srv/squid_cache directory so far
